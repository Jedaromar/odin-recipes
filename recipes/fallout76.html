        <li>2 Shallots (chopped)</li>
        <li>3 Garlic cloves (minced)</li>
        <li>1 lb Ground lamb</li>
        <li>1 lb Ground chicken</li>
        <li>1/2 Cup of panko</li>

        <li>1/2 Tablespoons of pepper</li>
        <li>1/4 Cups of minced parsley</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine the cranberries, orange juice, lemon juice, orange zest, lemon zest, sugar, and honey in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Stir together and bring to a boil. Reduce to low and allow to simmer for 10 minutes, allowing the cranberries to split open.</li>
        <li>Lightly mash the cranberries. Add the tomato paste and mix together well. Add the tomato sauce, water, salt, oregano, garlic powder, and onion powder. Let simmer for 5 minutes. Set aside until the meatballs are cooked.</li>
        <li>Heat a pan with olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the shallots and cook until just softened. Add the garlic and cook for another 2 minutes. Remove from the heat and place on a plate with a paper towel to drain the excess oil. Allow to cool completely.</li>
        <li>Combine the ground lamb, ground chicken, panko, egg, salt, fennel seed, pepper, parsley, and cooked shallots in a large bowl. Stir together until just combined. Split into 80 gram meatballs, you should end up with about 14 – 17.</li>
        <li>Heat a large pan with canola oil over medium-high heat. Add the meatballs and brown each side and cook through. Add the cranberry sauce to the pan and simmer over medium heat for 5 to 10 minutes. Serve on a bun and top with giardiniera.</li>
